For this assessment we implent a weather website where you can type in a city name, the website will show you the current weather and forecast for that city. It will also keep a history of the cities you've searched for. When you look at the current weather for a city, you'll see the name of the city, the date, and information about the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. When you look at the forecast for a city, you'll see a prediction for the next 5 days, including information about the temperature, wind speed, and humidity. If you want to look at the weather for a city you've already searched for, you can click on it in the search history and it will show you the same information again.
